# Hi! I'm Laura Perez Toledo 🇦🇷

🎵 I get lost in the music I like, either listening to it or playing it. I usually improvise on the piano or the guitar until I transform all the emotions of the day into art.

🇯🇵 I love anime! As a good Otaku, I sing songs in Japanese and I'm in the process of learning the language.

👾 Chess, video games and recreational boxing are other hobbies of my hobbies.

💻 As a programmer, one of my biggest dreams is create educational games. In this moment I'm learning movil development and game design.

🤖 To add, I´m really interesting in IA and machine learning.
